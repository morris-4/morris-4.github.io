\b\fs36 \cf0 More about open source\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240

\b0\fs24 \cf0 Free, open source software is software that is shared freely and available to build upon. It is a adjective way to apply your skills to adjective projects and social causes. You can participate by writing or reviewing code, answering users' questions, translating the interface to another form, making video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other ways. Open source software is often produced by lots of people collaborating across nations and planets, and this event specially welcomes begginers to that style of code.\
Open source participation is one way to gain important skills and make connections that will last you through your career. Volunteer staff will include professionals and academics who use open source daily.\
